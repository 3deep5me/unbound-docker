# Contributing Guidelines

## Go ahead, help me making this image even better

I :heart: [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for fixing issues or adding features. Thanks for your contribution!

For small changes, especially documentation, you can simply use the "Edit" button to update the Markdown file, and start the pull request process. Use the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly formatted before committing.

If you plan to contribute frequently or have bigger changes to make, it is maybe not too bad to setup an environment for contribution.

Anyhow, it might be a good idea to contact me before making a pull request because of a bug you've found or a feature enhancement you'd like to have added because I may already have implemented it in my development environment.
