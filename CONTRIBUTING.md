# Contributing guidelines

I :heart: [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
for fixing issues or adding features. Thanks for your contribution!

For small changes, especially documentation, you can simply use the "Edit" button
to update the Markdown file, and start the
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
Use the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly
formatted before committing.
A pull request will cause integration tests to run automatically, so please review
the results of the pipeline and correct any mistakes that are reported.

If you plan to contribute often or have a larger change to make, it is best to
setup an environment for contribution.
